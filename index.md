# Modified Attribution License (MAL) v1.0  

The **Modified Attribution License (MAL) v1.0** is a permissive software license that allows full freedom to use, modify, and distribute software while ensuring proper attribution for unmodified versions. It also allows relicensing of modified versions, making it a flexible alternative to traditional open-source licenses.

**You Can:**  
- Use, modify, and distribute the software.  
- Sell or license both **original and modified versions** under any terms.  
- Include in open-source or proprietary projects.  

**You Cannot:**
