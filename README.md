# Modified Attribution License (MAL) v1.0  

The **Modified Attribution License (MAL) v1.0** is a permissive software license that allows full freedom to use, modify, and distribute software while ensuring proper attribution for unmodified versions. It also allows relicensing of modified versions, making it a flexible alternative to traditional open-source licenses.
